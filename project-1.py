# # Project 1: Processing health and activity data [40 marks]
#

# 
# Make sure you read the instructions in `README.md` before starting! In particular, make sure your code is well-commented, with sensible structure, and easy to read throughout your notebook.
# 
# ---
# 
# The MMASH dataset [1, 2] is is a dataset of health- and activity-related measurements taken on 22 different people, over a continuous period of 24 hours, using wearable devices.
# 
# In this project, we have provided you with some of this data for **10** of those individuals. In the `dataset` folder, you will find:
# 
# - a file `subject_info.txt` which summarises the age (in years), height (in cm), and weight (in kg) of all 10 study participants,
# - 10 folders named `subject_X`, which each contain two files:
#     - `heartbeats.txt` contains data on all individual heartbeats detected over the 24-hour study period,
#     - `actigraph.txt` contains heart rate and other activity data measured with another device, over the same 24-hour period.
# 
# The tasks below will guide you through using your Python skills to process some of this data. Note that the data was reformatted slightly for the purpose of the assignment (to make your life a bit easier!), but the values are all the original ones from the real dataset.
# 
# ### Getting stuck
# 
# Tasks 3 to 8 follow directly from each other. There is a `testing` folder provided for you with `.npy` files and a supplementary `actigraph.txt` dataset. The `.npy` files are NumPy arrays, which you can load directly using `np.load()`, containing an example of what the data should look like after each task. You will be able to use this example data to keep working on the later tasks, even if you get stuck on an earlier task. Look out for the ðŸ’¾ instructions under each task.
# 
# These were produced using the data for another person which is not part of the 10 you have in your dataset.

# ## Task 2: Charting the Body Mass Index (BMI) for all participants
# 
# The Body Mass Index (BMI) can be used to indicate whether someone is at a healthy body weight. [The NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/what-is-the-body-mass-index-bmi/) describes it as follows:
# 
# > The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
# >
# > The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres, squared. For example, a BMI of $25$ means $25 \text{kg/m}^2$.
# >
# > For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the $18.5$ to $24.9$ range.
# 
# This means that the BMI is calculated as follows:
# 
# $$
# \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}.
# $$

# 
# Your function should not return anything, but calling it with `bmi_chart(info)` must be sufficient to display the visualisation.

# ## Task 3: Instantaneous heart rate data
# 
# For each subject, the file `heartbeats.txt` contains data on all individual heartbeats detected over the 24-hour study period. Specifically, the two columns record the time at which each heartbeat was detected, and the interval (in seconds) between the current heartbeat and the previous one.

# ### Handling timestamp data
# 
# For the next tasks, you will use NumPy's `datetime64[s]` and `timedelta64[s]` object types, respectively used to represent times (as if read on a clock) and time intervals. You should [consult the relevant documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html#datetimes-and-timedeltas).
# 
# Here are a few illustrative examples:

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# Create two datetime objects and a vector of dates
start_time = np.datetime64('2022-10-20 12:00:00')

# Divide by the duration of 1 day to get number of days
days_elapsed = time_elapsed / np.timedelta64(1, 'D')
print('days:',days_elapsed)
print(type(days_elapsed))

# Create a range of datetimes spaced by 1 day
step = np.timedelta64(1, 'D')

# ## Task 5: Interpolating the data
# 
# Although the device detecting heartbeats was able to measure intervals between beats with millisecond precision, the recorded timestamps could only record the second at which a heartbeat occurred. This means that there are not only time gaps in the data (due to the device missing heartbeats), but also several heartbeats usually recorded in the same second.
# 
# For example, this is an excerpt from Subject 7's data, showing a 9-second time gap between `09:19:57` and `09:20:06`, as well as 3 different heartbeats detected at `09:20:06`:
# 
# ```
# 59,2022-07-21 09:19:56,1.033
# 60,2022-07-21 09:19:57,0.942
# 61,2022-07-21 09:20:06,0.307
# 62,2022-07-21 09:20:06,0.439
# 63,2022-07-21 09:20:06,0.297
# 64,2022-07-21 09:20:07,0.427
# ```
# 
# The goal of this next task is to **interpolate** the recorded data, in order to produce a new dataset containing values of the heart rate at regular time intervals. We will use **linear interpolation**, with the help of SciPy's `interp1d()` function (from the `interpolate` module) which we saw in Week 5.

# ## Task 6: Smoothing the data with a rolling average
# 
# A rolling average is simply an average of the heart rate data, calculated over a given window of time. For example:
# 
# - The 20-second rolling average of the heart rate at a time `10:20:00` is the average heart rate over the 20 seconds leading up to that time, i.e. the average of all the heart rates between `10:19:41` and `10:20:00` (inclusive). If we have measurements of the heart rate every 5 seconds, then this would be the average of the heart rates measured at `10:19:45`, `10:19:50`, `10:19:55`, and `10:20:00`.
# - We can similarly calculate the 20-second rolling average at the next measurement time, `10:20:05`, as the average heart rate over the 20-second period from `10:19:46` to `10:20:05` (inclusive).
# 
# The rolling average essentially smoothes out the sudden jumps in the measured (or interpolated) heart rate data, allowing us to see the longer-term variations more clearly.
# 
# ---
# ðŸš© ***Task 6:*** Write a function `rolling_average()` which takes as inputs:
# 
# - two NumPy vectors `times` and `hr` such as those returned by `clean_data()`,
# - a `timedelta64[s]` object `time_delta` representing a time interval in seconds,
# - a `timedelta64[s]` object `window`, representing the window duration in seconds (with `window` assumed to be an integer multiple of `time_delta`),
# 
# and returns a NumPy vector `hr_rolling` containing values for the rolling average of the heart rate over time, with the given window size.
# 
# Your `rolling_average()` function should call `generate_interpolated_hr()` to generate regularly-spaced heart rate data with a time interval `time_delta`, before computing and returning the averaged heart rate data.
# 
# Note that `hr_rolling` will be shorter than the length of your interpolated heart rate data, because you can only start computing rolling averages after one window of time has elapsed. (For instance, if your data starts at `10:20:00`, with a 30-second window, the first value of the rolling average you can obtain is at `10:20:29`.)

# ## Task 7: Putting it all together
# 
# You should now have a series of functions which allow you to:
# 
# - read data on measured heartbeart-to-heartbeat intervals for a given subject,
# - transform this data into heart rate measurements and clean out the outliers,
# - interpolate the data to generate measurements at regular time intervals,
# - compute a rolling average of the heart rate data over time, to smooth out the data.
# 
# For each subject, there is another file `actigraph.txt`, containing activity data recorded by a separate device. In particular, this data provides another independent measurement of the subjects' heart rate. We can use this to check our work.
# 
# ---
# ðŸš© ***Task 7:*** Write a function `display_heart_rate(subject)` which takes as input an integer `subject` between 1 and 10, and produces one single graph, containing two plots on the same set of axes:
# 
# - a plot of the heart rate data found in `actigraph.txt` over time,
# - a plot of the smoothed heart rate data computed by you from the data in `heartbeats.txt`, using interpolated measurements of the heart rate every 3 seconds, and a 30-second window size for the averaging.
# 
# Your plot should show good agreement between the two sets of data. Instead of showing the full 24 hours of data, you should choose a period of time over which to plot the heart rate (say, approximately 1 hour), in order to better visualise the results.
# 
# Show an example by using your function to display the results for 3 subjects of your choice.

# ## Task 8: relating to other data
# 
# The data in `actigraph.txt` also contains the following columns:
# 
# - `Steps` indicates the number of steps detected per second (using a pedometer).
# - `Inclinometer Standing`/`Sitting`/`Lying` indicates the position of the subject, automatically detected by the device.
# - `Inclinometer Off` indicates when the device didn't record a position.
# 
# In particular, the `Inclinometer ...` columns record either `0` or `1`, and they are mutually exclusive over each row. This means that, for example, a subject can't be recorded simultaneously sitting and standing.
